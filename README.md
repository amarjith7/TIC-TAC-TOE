# TIC-TAC-TOE
A simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python.

Features:
Play against another human player.
Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g. non-integer or out-of-range values).
Detects and announces the winner or a tie.
Offers to play again or quit.

The game consists of two classes: Board and Game. The Board class represents the 3x3 grid and provides methods for displaying and updating it. The Game class orchestrates the turns, validates the inputs, and checks for a win or tie condition. The game loop alternates between the players until a win or tie occurs, or the game is quit.
